                <h2>Why is computer programming important for the future?</h2>
                <p>       
                    Programming is crucial when it comes to learning how to innovate, create very eco-friendly solutions for global problems and such. 
                    In essence, it helps in speeding up the input and output processes in a machine. Additionally, it helps you develop the ability to automate, 
                    collect, manage, analyze the data and information correctly.

                    Programming is, without a doubt, very imporant. Hundreds of universities, thousands of professors, students and practitioners teaching,
                    learning and practicing the discipline of programming are the purest testimony to the fact. And that's why programming is the skill you have to learn.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the more reasons why programming is important are:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The interaction with machines and computers
                    Harnessing the power of computing in all human endeavor
                    Automatization of tasks
                    Creating intelligent machines
                    We can only speculate further as to why programming is important today and will be in the future for that matter. What we can do though is
                    elaborate on why programming is important to programmers.

                    Why is computer programming important for the future?

                    My very first meeting with programming was back in high-school with C. I had learned C programming one summer by reading this book I found 
                    called ‘Let us C.' Over time, though, due to lack of practice and use I forgot most of the stuff. It didn't help that I was pursuing an 
                    education in a discipline that had little need of or exposure to programming(or so I was led to believe.)

                    I accumulated up a little python from the internet through tutorials and classes(none of which I have been able to complete so far.) Thankfully 
                    some of my old association with C has come in handy and I haven't had to start from scratch. So far, I have written scripts that help me populate
                    spreadsheets, fetch stock data, etc. And I am hopeful that as I continue to learn my skills will become useful in more ways.

                    Having said all this, I wouldn't go so far as to suggest that programming is for everybody and that learning to code should for a necessary part 
                    of education or anything. Programming is a skill set, a necessary and fulfilling skill-set to have but not a must. There are all sorts of people
                    and activities out there who wouldn't or needn't learn to program. As for the rest of us: there are assignments due and work to be done.
